# PizzaStore

I think this was a default app or something?

Idk. PizzaStore, cool. I'll probably delete this all and figure out how todo it a couple different ways.

1. How do I get OpenAPI involved?
2. How do I containerize this?
3. Get re-familiar with EF and Dapper, and other .NET storage options
