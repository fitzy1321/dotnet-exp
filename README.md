# Dotnet Experiments

It's been a while since I've written anything C#, but I got hired for a .NET role, so back to the Microsoft Stack for awhile.

## C# and Docker

I want to spin up a .NET API in a docker container. How do?

## C# and OpenAPI Standards

What's .NET story for observability patterns?

## EF vs Dapper vs other ?

## c# and Rust?

I want to write a library in Rust and expose it to C# code. How can I do that?

Probably FFI, C bindgens, dlls, and some other shit.
